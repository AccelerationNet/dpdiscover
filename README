	Displays Host Status
	Displays DNS Name
	Displays SNMP Status and Information
	Link to add device to Cacti.
	Allows Discovery Templates to allow adding the device to Cacti

----[ Changelog

    --- 1.0 ---
    - FDP!  Tested even.  Turns out we have Brocades that don't have LLDP on.
    - Code for IPv6 only hosts as hostnames added as "udp6:hostname.com". Not
      tested.

    --- 0.4 ---
    - IPv6 has been tested.  Code has been written so that, if using IP as the
      hostname, the IP is added as 'udp6:[IPv6::IP]'.  However, I think if you
      use the FQDN as the hostname, this won't work if there's no v4 address
      for the name (in other words, I'd have to add the FQDN as
      udp6:hostname.com for it to work, and that code isn't there yet).  IPv6
      operation may be heavily dependent on which SNMP you're using; Net-SNMP
      should work fine, but YMMV.
    - Options to use or not use LLDP or CDP are provided.  If both are
      selected, a host will be scanned with both (LLDP first, then CDP) no
      matter what the device returns with LLDP.  However, the code should
      operate in such a way as to only add a device once if it shows up in
      both LLDP and CDP.

    --- 0.3 ---
    - BUG FIX: findhosts.php was not reading in dpdiscover_parent_filter
      properly, so it would use parent without filtering.

    --- 0.2 ---
    - Report tab cleaned up.
    - Name unification - a lot less "dpdiscovery" than before.
    - Email report includes devices found, with valid IP, but not added or
      known.
    - Will take settings from 0.1, delete them, add them with new names

    --- 0.1 ---
    Initial release, based heavily on the original Auto Discovery plugin.
    This version only tries LLDP and (failing that), CDP.
